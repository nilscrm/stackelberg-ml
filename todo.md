- [x] optuna the MAL thing for sample efficiency
    - [ ] make new graphs for MAL 
    - [ ] so sample-graph for the best parameters
    - [ ] potentially if time permits, redo the ablation study on reward + noise params
- [ ] sample efficiency of PAL
    - [ ] optuna it again to get best hyperparameters
    - [ ] sample-graph for best hyperparameters
- [ ] merge with Tabular branch 
    - [x] enforce MAX_SAMPLES limit in tabular
    - [ ] graph sample efficiency of tabular
    - [ ] maybe even optuna the noise or other params 
- [ ] try to implement my algo which directly optimizes over the oracle vector
    - [ ] optuna to get best hyperparams
    - [ ] graph sample efficiency of this
